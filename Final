 * description: User enters a sentence and based off their choices, the program manipulates the 
 * sentence and displays the output of the new sentence. Can also count the number of words/occurences
 * of things in the sentence
 * 
 * pseudocode:
 * 1. ask user to enter a sentence
 * 2. loop menu giving options to user
 * 3. A) Enter new sentence
 * 	- let user enter a new sentence and replace the other one
 * 4. B) Search for word
 * 	- user enters word
 * 	- if found, display its index
 * 	- else, display not found
 * 5. C) Search for all incidences of a string
 * 	- user enters word they want to search
 *  - if found, display index of letter/word, replace with a space, and loop until all are found
 *  - else, display not found
 *  6. D) Capitalize a word
 *  - user enters word to capitalize
 *  - if found, user picks yes or no to caps it
 *  	- if yes, word is caps, display new sentence
 *  	- if no, display word not changed
 *  - else, display not found
 *  7. E) Replace word with another
 *  - ask user word they want changed, and the replacement
 *  -check if word is found
 *  - if found, loop until all incidences replaced then display new sentece
 *  - else, display not found
 *  8. F) Count number of words
 *  - split sentence at the spaces and place into an array
 *  -display the length of the array
 *  9. G) Count number of specific letter/word
 *  -search if word found
 *  -if found, loop and replace letter/word with space, and add a tracker that increases by 1 each time
 *  -display occurrences 
 *  10. H) Count all letters
 *  - replace the space with nothing
 *  -split all everything from between the letters, and place that in an array
 *  -display the length of the array
 *  11. I)Delete all occurrences of a word
 *  - search for word
 *  - replace word with and empty character
 *  - display new sentence
 *  12. J) End program
 *  -display goodbye message
 *  13.if user enters anything other than the given options, display message saying to pick above options
 *
